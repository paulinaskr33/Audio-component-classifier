# Audio-component-classifier

![pipeline](notebooks/data/img/pipeline.png)

## About
This project tackles the challenge of recognizing various sounds simultaneously within a single audio recording. Inspired by the "cocktail party problem," our approach combines audio classification with techniques for separating mixed audio sources.

The proposed method involves:

1. Extracting audio from video using `moviepy`.
2. Segmenting the audio into smaller chunks using a predefined time window.
3. Separating audio components within each chunk using the [Separate Anything You Describe model](https://github.com/Audio-AGI/AudioSep) and leveraging AudioSep, a natural language-based sound separation approach.
4. Classifying the separated components using [Microsoft's CLAP model](https://github.com/microsoft/CLAP), which utilizes contrastive language to categorize audio based on pre-trained text-audio relationships.
5. Generating video subtitles with audio captions using the SubRipper (.srt) format.

This framework enables the identification of multiple sounds within a complex audio scene, facilitating applications like automated audio annotation and content indexing.

## Preparation
1. Clone the reposotory and install dependencies:

```bash 
  pip install torchlibrosa==0.1.0 gradio==3.47.1 gdown lightning ftfy braceexpand webdataset soundfile wget h5py transformers==4.28.1 && \
  pip install msclap
```
